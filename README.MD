## Goals
This fork of OpenInv was created when the lag caused by offline player lookups post-UUID migration became too much to bear. Overall, it does not differ much from the original.

### Changes of Note
- Removed updater
- Removed wand

## Previous Versions
Any version of Minecraft this fork has been existent for should have a [release](https://github.com/Jikoo/OpenInv/releases) tagged. Features are not backported, however.
