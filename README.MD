## Goals
This fork of OpenInv was created when the lag caused by offline player lookups post-UUID migration became too much to bear. Overall, it does not differ much from the original.

### Changes of Note
- Removed updater
- Removed wand
- New configuration option `DisableSaving`: Inventory edits will not be saved unless the user is online.

## Previous Versions
This fork supports any version after 1.4.5. Binaries are available in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Jikoo/OpenInv/releases). Please allow a brief period after the release of a new version for updates.
